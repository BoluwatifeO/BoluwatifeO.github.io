                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>The rise of digital technology as a significant force in our lives has been one of the most
                            stunning technological breakthroughs of the last fifty years.
                            Nowadays, organizations are becoming more reliant on their information systems. The
                            general population has become concerned about the system's ability to save their information,
                            data, and, most importantly, personal information.
                            Furthermore, as there are now so many hackers around the world, their worry of system
                            hackers and identity theft has heightened their apprehension about using information systems.
                            Alarms about stolen or lost data are becoming increasingly common in all headline news as
                            firms rely more and more heavily on computers to maintain crucial company and customer
                            information. It is vital to be concerned about information security because a large portion of a
                            company's value is based on the value of its information.
                            The sole purpose of this research is to analyse the parameters such as providing detailed
                            information on Information Technology security, the types of IT security, the importance of
                            IT security, the history of Cybersecurity, along with the similarities and differences between
                            IT security and Cybersecurity.

                        <h2>What is Information Technology security?</h2>
                        <p>IT security guards against unauthorized access to company assets such as computers,
                            networks, and data. It safeguards sensitive data's integrity and confidentiality by preventing
                            sophisticated hackers from obtaining it.</p>
                        <h4><u>Types of IT security</u></h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Internet security:</b> Internet security includes the protection of information sent and
                                received in browsers, as well as network security affecting web-based applications.
                                These measures are designed to analyze incoming internet traffic for viruses and other
                                malicious information. This protection can be provided by firewalls, antimalware, and
                                antispyware software.
                                </li>
                            <li><b>Network security:</b> The purpose of network security is to keep unauthorized or
                                malicious users out of the network. This ensures that the usability, dependability, and
                                integrity of the system are not threatened. This level of protection is essential to
                                prevent a hacker from accessing network data. It also prevents them from interfering
                                with users' access to or use of the network.
                                Network security has become increasingly difficult as organizations increase the
                                number of endpoints and migrate services to the public cloud.
                            </li>
                           <li><b>Cloud security:</b> Because applications, data, and identities are shifting to the cloud,
                            people are connecting directly to the Internet and are not protected by the traditional
                            security stack.
                            6
                            Cloud security can help to protect software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications and
                            public cloud usage. Cloud security can be achieved by utilizing a Cloud Access
                            Security Broker (CASB), a Secure Internet Gateway (SIG), and cloud-based Unified
                            Threat Management (UTM) (UTM).
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Endpoint security:</b> Devices are protected at the endpoint level via endpoint security.
                            Endpoint security can safeguard devices such as cell phones, tablets, laptops, and
                            desktop PCs. Endpoint security keeps devices from connecting to hostile networks
                            that represent a risk to businesses. Advanced malware protection and device
                            management tools are included in endpoint security.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Application security:</b> To ensure that programs cannot be hacked, they are
                            specifically coded to be the safest they can possibly be at the time of their
                            construction. As an additional layer of protection, the software's code is analyzed to
                            find any faults that may exist within it.
                        </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4><u>Why is Information Technology security important for businesses?</u></h4>
                        <p>IT security ensures that applications implemented on an organization's information
                            technology infrastructure run safely. This is because, in order to protect the data, the company
                            will utilize or install appropriate software to secure the data, such as antivirus and other
                            protected apps. To safeguard the programs that are installed and the data stored on computers,
                            information security is essential in an organization. Aside from data protection, the
                            application deployed must also be protected because it may cause data damage or injury.
                            Information Technology security will protect the data collected and used by the organization.
                            If the information is not protected, it can be accessed by anyone. If the information falls into
                            the hands of the wrong people, it has the power to kill lives, destroy businesses, and wreak
                            havoc. IT security programs will ensure that the organization's data is protected in accordance
                            with corporate and legal standards by implementing measures to safeguard the data. In
                            addition to protecting an organization's information, taking precautions to prevent identity
                            theft is also a matter of protecting one's privacy.

                                moment. Creeper was invented as a worm, a form of computer virus that replicates
                                and spreads to other systems, by Bolt, Beranek, and Newman. Creeper, unlike today's
                                hazardous infestations, just displayed messages.

                            <li><b>The First U.S. Patent on Cybersecurity:</b> September 20, 1983, As computers began
                                to advance, innovators and technology specialists from over the world rushed to make
                                history by obtaining patents for novel computer systems.
                                MIT got the first U.S. patent for cybersecurity in September 1983, U.S. Patent
                                4,405,829 for a “cryptographic communications system and method.” The patent
                                introduced the RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) algorithm, which was one of the first
                                public-key cryptosystems. Cryptography is the foundation of modern cybersecurity
                            </li>
                            <li><b>The First DEF CON Conference was held on June 9, 1993:</b> DEF CON is a globally
                                recognized cybersecurity technical conference. It was founded by Jeff Moss in June
                                1993 in Las Vegas with a staff of about 100 individuals. Over 30,000 cybersecurity
                                specialists from around the world are expected to attend the conference.

                            <li><b>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 2.0 is born in February 1995:</b> The Secure Sockets
                                Layer (SSL) internet protocol enabled the security protocol that allows people to
                                conduct simple things like making secure online purchases. Netscape began
                                developing the SSL protocol not long after the National Center for Supercomputing
                                Applications released the first web browser. In February 1995, Netscape released SSL
                                2.0, which laid the groundwork for the HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure language,
                                which is used to securely access the web. When we see the initials "HTTPS" in the
                                URL of a website, we know that the website's communications with the browser are
                                secure.

                        <h2>IT security VS Cybersecurity</h2>
                        <h4><u>The similarities between IT security and cybersecurity:</u></h4>
                        <p>Both terms refer to techniques that try to provide computer systems with security and
                            protection against hostile activities and data breaches.
                            Moreover, IT security and cybersecurity are closely related disciplines. They include
                            comparable and complementary processes, but they must be distinguished to achieve an
                            effective and successful application.
                            IT security and cybersecurity both have a component that deals with the physical protection
                            of data. Both techniques take various precautions to keep the information safe, such as
                            locking the server room door and granting authorization to particular individuals.
                            Furthermore, IT security and cybersecurity assess the worth of the data they seek to
                            safeguard. In other words, both techniques strive to concentrate on the most critical facts.
                            Assume, for example, that a person owns a bank. The list of client names is significant data,
                            but the ID numbers, PIN codes, or addresses of these consumers are more important to
                            secure. Most steps are made in both IT security and cybersecurity to secure the most sensitive
                            data as best as possible.
                        </p>
                        <h4> <u>Differences between IT security and cybersecurity:</u></h4>
                        <p>The goal of IT security is to keep an organization's data secure and reliable. As the broad
                            description implies, IT security encompasses a wide range of issues, including cybersecurity.
                            That is, one can be an IT expert without specializing in cybersecurity.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Cybersecurity</b>, like <b>IT security</b>, strives to keep information safe, but it focuses specifically
                            on data in digital form: mobile devices, tablets, laptops, workstations, servers, networks, and
                            so on. The goal of all cybersecurity practices is to prevent unwanted access to electronic data.
                            To do this, cybersecurity specialists use various protocols and methods, including identifying
                            sensitive and/or valuable data, the mitigation of vulnerable areas in an organization's security
                            façade, risk assessment, and much more.
                        </p>
                        <p>As previously stated, both IT security and cybersecurity seek to safeguard information. IT
                            security encompasses a broader range of issues. It focuses on safeguarding critical data
                            against all types of threats. Furthermore, it interacts with both digital and analogue
                            information. While cybersecurity focuses on digital information, it also deals with other
                            issues such as cybercrime, cyber assaults, cyberfraud, and law enforcement.

                        <p>Any probable occurrence, whether malicious or not, that has the potential to harm an asset is
                            considered a threat. A <b>threat</b>, in other words, is any unfavourable occurrence that may occur
                            to assets.
                        </p>
                        <p>Any activity that exploits a vulnerability or poses a threat is considered an <b>attack</b>. Two types
                            of attacks are sending malicious input to an application or flooding a network in an attempt to
                            deny service.
                        </p>
                        <p>A weakness that allows a danger to occur is known as <b>vulnerability</b>. This could be a result of
                            poor design, inappropriate settings, or insecure coding techniques.

                            <li>A threat and an assault differ primarily in that a threat can be either purposeful or

                            <li>An attack is an attempt to cause damage, whereas a threat is a circumstance that has

                                <br>Unstructured threats frequently entail unfocused attacks on one or more network
                                systems, which are frequently carried out by individuals with little or emerging
                                abilities. The offender is most likely unaware of the systems being targeted and
                                infected. These attacks are typically carried out by people who lack integrity and have
                                an abundance of idle time on their hands. Malicious intent may or may not exist, but
                                indifference to the harm done to others is always there.
                                Innumerable sites on the Internet offer computer codes such as a Trojan horse or a
                                virus that can be updated or copied in its entirety. In each case, these are small
                                programs designed by humans. They are not alive and cannot evolve from anything.

                                be damaged if word of an assault on its website spreads, or users' liberties can be
                                curtailed when more stringent policies and practices are developed to defend against
                                future attacks, even if the initial purpose was more thoughtless than malicious.</p>

                                <br>More targeted than unstructured attacks, structured threats come from those with
                                higher-level knowledge who purposefully strive to compromise an entire system.
                                Depending on how the system was discovered, it could have been a result of a random
                                search, or it could have been deliberately picked. Assailants are frequently
                                well-versed in hacking tools, network designs, and security protocols, and they are
                                able to develop scripts or apps to accomplish their goals.
                                Structured attacks are motivated by factors other than curiosity or peer competition.
                                It's possible that the projects are motivated by greed, politics, racism (or any other
                                form of intolerance), or law enforcement, among other factors. Incentives include
                                identity theft and credit card information theft, as well as other crimes when the
                                payout is not directly tied to the attack.

                                <br><b>Case 1: </b> Employee negligence resulted in the leak of a Microsoft database.
                                    <p>What transpired?
                                    A security researcher discovered a publicly available Microsoft customer support
                                    database with 250 million records accumulated over 14 years at the end of December
                                    2019. Customer emails and IP addresses were stored in the database, as were the notes
                                    taken by Microsoft support personnel.
                                    The database was exposed to the public for nearly a month. Microsoft patched it the
                                    same day the problem was reported.</p>
                                    <p>What were the consequences?
                                    Due to the fact that the exposed data did not contain personally identifiable
                                    information, Microsoft was not fined or penalized, and the business took swift action
                                    to remedy the matter and warned users.
                                    When it came to Microsoft's data breach, it was lucky that it was found towards the
                                    tail end of 2019. The California Consumer Privacy Act went into effect a few days
                                    later, on January 3, 2020. Everyone who is harmed as a result of a violation faces a
                                    $750 fine under this law. Microsoft may have been penalized millions of dollars under
                                    the new legislation.</p>
                                    <p>What caused that to happen?
                                    A new version of the Azure security rules was issued by Microsoft at the beginning of
                                    December 2019. An unintentional leak was caused by Microsoft workers mishandling
                                    such restrictions. As a result, no password or two-factor authentication was used to
                                    protect access to the database. Furthermore, the company's detection time may have
                                    been greatly shortened by monitoring user data and analyzing conduct regarding
                                    sensitive assets.</p>
                                <br><b>Case 2: </b>Marriott's data was compromised as a result of a hacked third-party app.
                                    <p>What transpired?
                                        An application used by Marriott to provide guest services was breached in January
                                        2020 by hackers. The attackers were able to acquire access to 5.2 million customer
                                        records at Marriott. Contact information, gender, birthdates, loyalty account data, and
                                        personal preferences were all included in these records. After noticing suspicious
                                        activity in February 2020, Marriott's security staff resolved the insider-caused security
                                        issue.</p>
                                    <p>What were the consequences?
                                        Because the compromised material contains personally identifiable information,
                                        Marriott may face substantial consequences.
                                        In 2018, Marriott had to defend GDPR fines of £99 million (approximately $124
                                        million) for a data breach.</p>
                                    <p>What caused that to happen?
                                        Using the credentials of two Marriott workers, the attackers got access to one of the
                                        hotel chain's third-party applications. For two months, Marriott's cybersecurity
                                        systems were unaware of any unusual behaviour on these employees' profiles.
                                        Marriott may have spotted the occurrence sooner if it had adopted third-party vendor
                                        monitoring and user and entity activity analytics.</p>

                                        keyloggers, which collect information from what you enter, such as
                                        passwords.</li>
                                    <li>Ransomware prohibits people from accessing computer systems by encrypting
                                        storage media and demanding a fee to be paid in order to regain access.</li>
                                    <li>Adware displays unwanted adverts in order to generate revenue, sometimes
                                        distracting the user by using pop-ups that do not close when dismissed.</li>

                                Viruses affect files, whereas rootkits alter the kernel. Integrity check works in OSSEC
                                (and similarly in other programs such as AIDE) by keeping the unique hash
                                MD5/SHA1 of the files and rechecking the system binary files every 6 hours (by
                                default, although this may be adjusted) to guarantee nothing has changed and to warn
                                if anything has changed. It is common for them to be modified without any unusual
                                behaviour, such as updating. In either instance, you will be notified to check. The
                                program searches for system files in [/etc,/usr/bin,/usr/sbin,/bin,/sbin] by default.

                            judging and punishing cyber crimes and cybercriminals, and local authorities are sometimes
                            unable to take action because of a lack of laws under which to prosecute. Attributing
                            cybercrime and cyberattacks is a major concern for all law enforcement agencies. "Computer
                            infections spread from one country to another, from one jurisdiction to another - all across the
                            world, taking advantage of our inability to conduct such global police operations. As a result,
                            the Internet is as if someone [had] handed all of the world's online criminals free plane
                            tickets." The use of technology such as dynamic DNS, rapid flux, and bulletproof servers

                                installation, implementation, development, and deployment of networking systems.
                                They are also in charge of administering those information systems and implementing
                                several levels of cybersecurity into the systems to stop or prevent cyber-attacks.

                                avoid cyberthreats. However, the precise scope of labour varies depending on the
                                nature and size of an organization. For example, an online firm like LinkedIn needs
                                data leak prevention, whereas working in cybersecurity for the government may entail
                                developing and maintaining a secure network that cannot be accessed by third parties.
                                An information security analyst's primary responsibilities include monitoring

                                software, and networks against cybercriminals. The analyst's major responsibility is to
                                thoroughly understand the company's IT architecture, monitor it at all times, and
                                evaluate risks that could potentially breach the network.

                                The cybersecurity analyst is constantly looking for methods to improve the security
                                of the company's network and secure sensitive information.
                                The cybersecurity analyst is also in charge of:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Configuring Tools: This could take the shape of virus software, password
                                        protection software, or vulnerability management software. They will assess
                                        the company's requirements and employ these tools to safeguard its data.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Reporting: The analyst will describe the current state of the network and
                                        evaluate its strengths. Learning to read these reports is one of the abilities
                                        required. They will display what is well-protected and alert you if there is any
                                        odd network activity.
                                        </li>
                                    <li>Assess Weaknesses: While no network is completely safe, the goal is to make
                                        it as secure as feasible. Part of the job entails constantly testing all company
                                        networks for flaws before bad actors or external threats may affect them.

                        <p>In conclusion, it is extremely important for organizations to utilize IT security in order to
                            guard against unauthorized access to company assets such as computers, networks, and data.
                            IT security prevents sophisticated hackers from obtaining information by safeguarding
                            sensitive data's integrity and confidentiality.
                            IT security and Cybersecurity refer to techniques that try to provide computer systems with
                            security and protection against hostile activities and data breaches. They include comparable
                            and complementary processes, but they must be distinguished to achieve an effective and
                            successful application. IT security encompasses a broader range of issues. While
                            cybersecurity focuses on digital information, it also deals with other issues such as
                            cybercrime, cyber assaults, cyberfraud, and law enforcement. Any probable occurrence,
                            whether malicious or not, that has the potential to harm an asset is considered a threat. Any
                            activity that exploits a vulnerability or poses a threat is considered an attack. Because these
                            threats are evolving, dynamic multi-point security solutions are essential.
                            Finally, IT security jobs are in the mainstream. IT security specialists are employed by
                            industries such as health care, retail, manufacturing, and finance to secure critical information
                            from cyber intrusions. There is a great demand for specialists in the field because of the
                            frequency of cyberattacks.</p>
